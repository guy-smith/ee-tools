This folder will contain the reevaluated "Beamer" method for estimating ET and ETg for input shapefiles.


New coefficients for the ET*-EVI relationship have been derived using the Landsat Collection 1 Surface Reflectance products
and new ET* values for all Eddy Covariance/Bowen Ratio flux tower measurements (40 original site-years and more recent 16 site-years).
